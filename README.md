# NUnit Governance Documents

This repository contains documents related to the overall governance of the NUnit organization as well as the individual projects under NUnit. It is currently under development.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that all NUnit projects are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in these projects you agree to abide by its terms.

## Structure of this Repository

The root directory contains approved and published documents describing overall governance of the nunit organization. Subdirectories are used for governance documentation specific to individual projects.

Draft documents at all levels are included in the `drafts` folder. We use this approach to make it clear which documents are still being worked on and which are in effect. The `notes` folder contains notes that will eventually form part of a document or that provide background for writing documents. Both `drafts` and `notes` are work in progress. They are published because we believe in transparency but they should not be taken as established policy.
