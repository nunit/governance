## NUnit Software Projects

The NUnit Community maintains an inventory of software projects, with the precise list varying over time. Projects are grouped in a number of categories.

### Core Projects

These projects are essential and are actively maintained at the highest priority. They belong to the NUnit Community and we will continue to maintain them and release them on a regular schedule as long as they are useful to our users. If the developers maintaining one of these projects drop out, we will recruit new team members and/or appoint a new project leader.

Note that a "project" in this context may not map one to one to GitHub repositories. That is, a single project may have multiple repos and (less frequently) a single repo may house multiple projects.

The Core Projects include:

* NUnit Framework
* NUnit Console
* NUnit Engine
* NUnit Visual Studio Test Adapter
* NUnit 3 Visual Studio Test Adapter

### Secondary Projects

These are projects that are important to us but which are subordinate to the Core Projects in some sense. They do not follow a regular release schedule and are only updated as necessary.

* NUnit Project Editor
* Core Engine Extensions
  * NUnit V2 Framework Driver
  * NUnit V2 Result Writer
  * NUnit Project Loader
  * VS Project Loader
* NUnit Xamarin
* NUnit.org Website
* NUnit Samples

### Pre-Production Projects

These are projects that are being developed but are not yet at the stage of a production release. Once released, the project will fall into one of the other categories. This group may include experimental projects as well.

* NUnit Gui
* NUnit Analyzers

### Contributed Projects

These are projects developed by others but distributed by and through our community. They are maintained by their individual developers who issue releases as needed. Normally, the project lead is the person who contributed the project. 

When a project is offered to us as a contribution, it's up to the Core Team to decide whether to accept it. The primary criterion for acceptance is that the project should conform to our vision and values for NUnit and should be "better off" in some sense as a part of the NUnit Project rather than being maintained separately. We don't consider giving the project a publicity boost as a sufficient reason for accepting it, as there are other ways we can do that. 

If the lead/contributor should decide to stop maintaining the contributed project Without arranging for a new maintainer, the Core Team would normally either archive it or drop it entirely from the NUnit Project.

Current contributed projects include

* NUnit VS Test Generator
* Team City Engine Extension
* NUnit 3 TD.Net Adapter
* NUnit VS Templates
* NUnit Transforms (Aggregates multiple contributions)

### Archived Projects

These are projects we no longer maintain, but which have the last version of the source code available in case someone needs to take them up again.

* NUnit V2
* NUnitLite 1.0
* NUnit for Compact Framework
* NUnit for Silverlight
* Dotnet Test NUnit
* NUnit Portable Agent
